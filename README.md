# kube-ps1: Kubernetes prompt for bash and zsh

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jonmosco/kube-ps1)
[![CI](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A script that lets you add the current Kubernetes context and namespace
configured on `kubectl` to your Bash/Zsh prompt strings (i.e. the `$PS1`).

Inspired by several tools used to simplify usage of `kubectl`.

### From Source (git clone)

1. Clone this repository
2. Source the kube-ps1.sh in your `~/.zshrc` or your `~/.bashrc`

#### Zsh

```sh
source /path/to/kube-ps1.sh
PROMPT='$(kube_ps1)'$PROMPT # or RPROMPT='$(kube_ps1)'
```
#### Bash

```sh
source /path/to/kube-ps1.sh
PS1='[\u@\h \W $(kube_ps1)]\$ '
```

## Requirements

The default prompt assumes you have the `kubectl` command line utility installed.
Official installation instructions and binaries are available:

[Install and Set up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

If using this with OpenShift, the `oc` tool needs installed.  It can be obtained
from brew ports:

```sh
brew install openshift-cli
```
or the source can be downloaded:

[OC Client Tools](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/releases)

Set the binary to `oc` with the following variable:

```sh
KUBE_PS1_BINARY=oc
```

If neither binary is available, the prompt will print the following:

```sh
(<symbol>|BINARY-N/A:N/A)
```

## Helper utilities

There are several great tools that make using kubectl very enjoyable:

- [`kubectx` and `kubens`](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) are great for
fast switching between clusters and namespaces.

## Tmux port

I have begun porting kube-ps1 to tmux as a status line plugin.  If you prefer
tmux, and like the functionality provided by kube-ps1, checkout the
[kube-tmux](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-tmux) project

## Prompt Structure

The default prompt layout is:

```
(<symbol>|<context>:<namespace>)
```

If the current-context is not set, kube-ps1 will return the following:

```
(<symbol>|N/A:N/A)
```

## Enabling/Disabling

If you want to stop showing Kubernetes status on your prompt string temporarily
run `kubeoff`. To disable the prompt for all shell sessions, run `kubeoff -g`.
You can enable it again in the current shell by running `kubeon`, and globally
with `kubeon -g`.

```
kubeon     : turn on kube-ps1 status for this shell.  Takes precedence over
             global setting for current session
kubeon -g  : turn on kube-ps1 status globally
kubeoff    : turn off kube-ps1 status for this shell. Takes precedence over
             global setting for current session
kubeoff -g : turn off kube-ps1 status globally
```

### Direnv Integration

If you only want to show the ps1 only when working in a specific directory while using a `.envrc` file from [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) disable it globally with `kubeoff -g`.
However setting the `kubeon` cmd in `.envrc` will not work, because it is a shell function. The solution for this problem is simply setting `export KUBE_PS1_ENABLED=on`. 

## Symbol

The default symbols are UTF8 and should work with most fonts. If you want to use the Kubernetes and OpenShift
glyphs, you need to install a patched font that contains the glyph. [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) provides both glyphs. Follow their installation instructions to install the patched font.

`KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_CUSTOM` options
| Options | Symbol | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| default (empty string) | ⎈      | Default symbol (Unicode `\u2388`) |
| img           | ☸️      | Symbol often used to represent Kubernetes (Unicode `\u2638`) |
| oc            | ![openshift-glyph](img/openshift-glyph.png) | Symbol representing OpenShift (Unicode `\ue7b7`) |
| k8s           | ![k8s-glyph](img/k8s-glyph.png) | Symbol representing Kubernetes (Unicode `\ue7b7`) |

To set the symbol to one of the custom glyphs, add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_CUSTOM=img
```

To set the symbol to the default, set the `KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL` to an empty string.

Heres a demo of the symbols in action:
![kube-ps1-symbols](img/kube-ps1-symbol-demo.gif)

If the font is not properly installed, and the glyph is not available, it will display an empty set of brackets or similar:

```sh
 echo -n "\ue7b7"
 
```

## Customization

The default settings can be overridden in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` by setting
the following variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| :------- | :-----: | ------- |
| `KUBE_PS1_BINARY` | `kubectl` | Default Kubernetes binary |
| `KUBE_PS1_NS_ENABLE` | `true` | Display the namespace. If set to `false`, this will also disable `KUBE_PS1_DIVIDER` |
| `KUBE_PS1_PREFIX` | `(` | Prompt opening character  |
| `KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_ENABLE` | `true ` | Display the prompt Symbol. If set to `false`, this will also disable `KUBE_PS1_SEPARATOR` |
| `KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_PADDING` | `false` | Adds a space (padding) after the symbol to prevent clobbering prompt characters |
| `KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_CUSTOM` | `⎈ ` | Change the Default prompt symbol. Unicode `\u2388`.  Options are `k8s`, `img`, `oc` |
| `KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_COLOR` | `blue` | Change the Default symbol color. |
| `KUBE_PS1_SEPARATOR` | &#124; | Separator between symbol and context name |
| `KUBE_PS1_DIVIDER` | `:` | Separator between context and namespace |
| `KUBE_PS1_SUFFIX` | `)` | Prompt closing character |
| `KUBE_PS1_CLUSTER_FUNCTION` | No default, must be user supplied | Function to customize how cluster is displayed |
| `KUBE_PS1_NAMESPACE_FUNCTION` | No default, must be user supplied | Function to customize how namespace is displayed |
| `KUBE_PS1_HIDE_IF_NOCONTEXT` | `false` | Hide the kube-ps1 prompt if no context is set |

To disable a feature, set it to an empty string:

```sh
KUBE_PS1_SEPARATOR=''
```

## Colors

The default colors are set with the following variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| :------- | :-----: | ------- |
| `KUBE_PS1_PREFIX_COLOR` | `null` | Set default color of the prompt prefix |
| `KUBE_PS1_SYMBOL_COLOR` | `blue` | Set default color of the Kubernetes symbol |
| `KUBE_PS1_CTX_COLOR` | `red` | Set default color of the context |
| `KUBE_PS1_SUFFIX_COLOR` | `null` | Set default color of the prompt suffix |
| `KUBE_PS1_NS_COLOR` | `cyan` | Set default color of the namespace |
| `KUBE_PS1_BG_COLOR` | `null` | Set default color of the prompt background |

Blue was used for the default symbol to match the Kubernetes color as closely
as possible. Red was chosen as the context name to stand out, and cyan for the
namespace.

Set the variable to an empty string if you do not want color for each
prompt section:

```sh
KUBE_PS1_CTX_COLOR=''
```

Names are usable for the following colors:

```
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan
```

256 colors are available by specifying the numerical value as the variable
argument.

## Customize display of cluster name and namespace

You can change how the cluster name and namespace are displayed using the
`KUBE_PS1_CLUSTER_FUNCTION` and `KUBE_PS1_NAMESPACE_FUNCTION` variables
respectively.

For the following examples let's assume the following:

cluster name: `sandbox.k8s.example.com`
namespace: `alpha`

If you're using domain style cluster names, your prompt will get quite long
very quickly. Let's say you only want to display the first portion of the
cluster name (`sandbox`), you could do that by adding the following:

```sh
function get_cluster_short() {
  echo "$1" | cut -d . -f1
}

KUBE_PS1_CLUSTER_FUNCTION=get_cluster_short
```

The same pattern can be followed to customize the display of the namespace.
Let's say you would prefer the namespace to be displayed in all uppercase
(`ALPHA`), here's one way you could do that:

```sh
function get_namespace_upper() {
    echo "$1" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
}

export KUBE_PS1_NAMESPACE_FUNCTION=get_namespace_upper
```

In both cases, the variable is set to the name of the function, and you must have defined the function in your shell configuration before kube_ps1 is called. The function must accept a single parameter and echo out the final value.

### Bug Reports and shell configuration

Due to the vast ways of customizing the shell, please try the prompt with a
minimal configuration before submitting a bug report.

This can be done as follows for each shell before loading kube-ps1:

Bash:

```sh
bash --norc
```

Zsh:

```sh
zsh -f
or
zsh --no-rcs
```

For the prompt symbol, a patched font that contains the glyphs must be installed.
[Nerd Fonts Downloads](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) provides patched
fonts containing the glyphs.  Please consult their documentation for this, support
is out of scope for this project.
